swarm
=====
Matthew DiBernardo [01.07.2015]

A reignition of the project that [rednet-transport-protocol](https://github.com/Cyrixus/rednet-transport-protocol) was supposed to grow into, now that RTP has been made defunct by improvements to the ComputerCraft API. The primary goal of swarm is to create a semi-autonomous distributed AI network using ComputerCraft computers and turtles, and then to leverage that network to automatically accomplish a number of tasks without user intervention (such as mining ores, harvesting trees and plants, constructing rudimentary buildings, etc).

Or, in simpler terms, it's a robotic world-conquering hivemind.

To install: From any http-enabled ComputerCraft device, execute "pastebin run B9jSimkc"

_Current Project Status:_
* Central Behavior processing works, could use some refinement.
* Incremental Mining Scripts are about 60% done. Several pages worth of notes need to be transformed into code.
* Helper Scripts and QoL improvements to execution should be a priority in the near future.

BE IT FOR THE SWARM!
